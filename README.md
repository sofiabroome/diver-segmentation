# diver-segmentation

This repository contains code to 1) fine-tune a MaskRCNN to segment diver instances from the Diving48 dataset, and 2) code to perform inference with such a model, and save the segmented clips as videos.

The manually labelled frames can be downloaded [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OXKE6E) from Harvard Dataverse. A trained model checkpoint is also available on the same page (search for `checkpoint` among the files).
